      NOTE: Have both `production` and `master` configurations is temporary.
      FAB has not yet implemented --env= support for their deploy command, so for the time
      being we're falling back to their default, which is `production`. This means that things will
      be correct in production, but for the time being `develop` will receive the incorrect `STAGE`.
